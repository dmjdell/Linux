You have to make sure the apache service is running in all the APP SERVERS



try again by clicking the tick mark near to the reply 


U have confits with the contents (Like the current update and the code on master is different so git will merge the code together
 and its up to you to resolve the confit ) .So what u have to do is remove all the contents from ====== to >>>>>>>> random numbers .
 Then remove the <<<<<<<< HEAD LINE ALSO. The final content of  story-index.txt should only contain the lines from 1 to 4 .
 Then commit and push to master.
 Login to Gitea  and check is    story-index.txt contains only 4 lines. Then  the task is done. Try again
