Create a Jenkins job which should be named devops-pipeline-job.

Configure this job to run a simple bash command to echo hello world!!.

Create a view named devops-crons (should be a List View) and make sure devops-pipeline-job and devops-cron-job (which is already present on Jenkins) jobs are listed under this new view.

Schedule this newly create job to build periodically at every minute i.e '* * * * *' (please make sure to use the cron expression exactly same how it is mentioned here)

Make sure the job builds successfully.


#!/bin/bash
echo "echo hello world!!"
