The Puppet server package is already installed on puppet master
 i.e jump server and the Puppet agent package is already installed on all App Servers.

 However, you may need to begin required services on all these servers.

Configure autosign configuration on the Puppet master i.e jump server (
by creating autosign.conf in puppet configuration directory) and assign certificates for both master node as well as for all agent nodes.
 Use host's FDQN to assign the certificates.

Use alias puppet (dns_alt_names) for master node and add its entry in /etc/hosts config file on master i.e Jump Server as well as on all agent nodes i.e App Servers.
